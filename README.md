# Windows WinDbg CPU Process Toolkit

This toolkit analyzes all the running processes by leveraging the Windows SDK and collects data for analysis and machine learning classification.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è
Make sure to run as Administrator if it is giving you compile or run-time issues.
1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Windows-WinDbg-CPU-Process-Toolkit.git
    cd Windows-WinDbg-CPU-Process-Toolkit
    ```

2. **Compile the Code**:
    Use `gcc` to compile the source code:
    ```sh
    gcc -o Locate_Code.exe Locate_Code.c -lgdi32 -lgdiplus -lpsapi -lshlwapi -ladvapi32 -lcomctl32
    gcc -o Process_Analyzer.exe Process_Analyzer.c -lgdi32 -lgdiplus -lpsapi -lshlwapi -ladvapi32 -lcomctl32
    ```

3. **Run the Application**:
    Execute the compiled application using the provided batch file:
    ```sh
    Run_Applications.bat
    ```


## Batch File: `Run_Applications.bat`
This batch file automates the process of running the compiled applications and keeps the windows on top using a PowerShell script.

## Powershell Script: `Process_Analyzer_FOREGROUND.ps1`
This powershell file is designed to keep machine source code at the front in order for our toolkit to analyze the information.


## Usage üíª
- **Start Scanning**: Click the "Start Scanning" button in the GUI to begin the process scanning and data extraction.
- **Stop Scanning**: Click the "Stop Scanning" button to halt the scanning process.
- **Error Handling**: Follow the on-screen prompts to handle error popups by clicking "OK" when necessary.

## Example Workflow üìù
1. **Initialization**: The application initializes and positions the command window to avoid overlaying the WinDbg source window.
2. **Scanning Loop**: The scanning loop continuously checks for the WinDbg window and captures text data.
3. **Error Handling**: When an error popup is detected, the user is prompted to click "OK", pausing the scanning process until resolved.
4. **Data Capture**: Captured data is saved to organized folders, labeled by process ID and name, for further analysis.
