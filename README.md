## Windows WinDbg CPU Process Toolkit

It essentially analyzes all the running processes it possibly can by leveraging the Windows SDK and collects the data, then performs analysis and machine learning classification.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è
1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Windows-WinDbg-CPU-Process-Toolkit.git
    cd Windows-WinDbg-CPU-Process-Toolkit
    ```

2. **Compile the Code**:
    Use `gcc` to compile the source code:
    ```sh
    gcc -o Locate_Code.exe Locate_Code.c -lgdi32 -lgdiplus -lpsapi -lshlwapi -ladvapi32 -lcomctl32
    ```

3. **Run the Application**:
    Execute the compiled application:
    ```sh
    Locate_Code.exe
    ```

## Usage üíª
- **Start Scanning**: Click the "Start Scanning" button in the GUI to begin the process scanning and data extraction.
- **Stop Scanning**: Click the "Stop Scanning" button to halt the scanning process.
- **Error Handling**: Follow the on-screen prompts to handle error popups by clicking "OK" when necessary.

## Example Workflow üìù
1. **Initialization**: The application initializes and positions the command window to avoid overlaying the WinDbg source window.
2. **Scanning Loop**: The scanning loop continuously checks for the WinDbg window and captures text data.
3. **Error Handling**: When an error popup is detected, the user is prompted to click "OK", pausing the scanning process until resolved.
4. **Data Capture**: Captured data is saved to organized folders, labeled by process ID and name, for further analysis.
