## Overview
The **Windows WinDbg CPU Process Toolkit** is a comprehensive solution designed to automate the process of capturing, analyzing, and managing CPU processes using WinDbg on Windows. This toolkit is ideal for developers, system administrators, and computer forensics professionals who need to extract detailed information from running processes for debugging and analysis purposes.

## Features ‚ú®
- üöÄ **Automated Process Scanning**: Continuously scan and capture information from all running processes using WinDbg.
- üìã **Clipboard Data Extraction**: Automatically copy and save data from the WinDbg window to local files.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Error Handling**: Detect and handle error popups, prompting user intervention to continue the process.
- üß† **Memory and Module Capture**: Read process memory and capture loaded modules, saving the information to transcribed and readable files.
- üñ•Ô∏è **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: User-friendly GUI with start and stop scanning controls for easy operation.
- üîê **Administrator Privileges Handling**: Ensure the application runs with the necessary administrative privileges for process analysis.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è
1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Windows-WinDbg-CPU-Process-Toolkit.git
    cd Windows-WinDbg-CPU-Process-Toolkit
    ```

2. **Compile the Code**:
    Use `gcc` to compile the source code:
    ```sh
    gcc -o Locate_Code.exe Locate_Code.c -lgdi32 -lgdiplus -lpsapi -lshlwapi -ladvapi32 -lcomctl32
    ```

3. **Run the Application**:
    Execute the compiled application:
    ```sh
    Locate_Code.exe
    ```

## Usage üíª
- **Start Scanning**: Click the "Start Scanning" button in the GUI to begin the process scanning and data extraction.
- **Stop Scanning**: Click the "Stop Scanning" button to halt the scanning process.
- **Error Handling**: Follow the on-screen prompts to handle error popups by clicking "OK" when necessary.

## Example Workflow üìù
1. **Initialization**: The application initializes and positions the command window to avoid overlaying the WinDbg source window.
2. **Scanning Loop**: The scanning loop continuously checks for the WinDbg window and captures text data.
3. **Error Handling**: When an error popup is detected, the user is prompted to click "OK", pausing the scanning process until resolved.
4. **Data Capture**: Captured data is saved to organized folders, labeled by process ID and name, for further analysis.
